# rest-api-nodejs
This is the backend node.js project which is being taught in Node.js Udemy Course.

In this projeect I have created REST APIs to fetch, create, edit, and to delete posts in a blog application. 
I have used JSON Web Tokens for implementing authentication.

While working on this project I learned about callbacks, promises, async await, fetch API, MongoDB Atlas, Heroku etc.
