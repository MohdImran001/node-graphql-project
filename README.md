# node-graphql-project
This is the backend Node.js GraphQL project which I learned from Node.js Udemy Course.

In this project I have created GraphQL API"'s' to fetch, create, edit, and to delete posts in a blog application. 
I have used JSON Web Tokens for implementing authentication.

While working on this project I learned about callbacks, promises, async await, fetch API, MongoDB Atlas, Heroku etc.
